    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Gajar ka halwa is particularly popular in North India during winter months when carrots are in season. It's often
        prepared for festivals and special occasions.</p>
    <p>The dessert is known for its vibrant orange color and comforting warmth. Its preparation involves slow-cooking,
        which
        reduces the milk and caramelizes the carrots, intensifying the flavors.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 tablespoons ghee or oil</li>
        <li>2 pounds carrots, grated</li>
        <li>1 ½ quarts whole milk</li>
        <li>2 cups white sugar</li>
        <li>½ cup raisins or sultanas</li>
        <li>1 ½ teaspoons ground cardamom</li>
        <li>1 pinch saffron threads</li>
        <li>8 tablespoons chopped pistachio nuts</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat ghee in a large saucepan over medium heat and add carrots. Cook and stir briefly, about 3 minutes. Pour in milk and
        increase heat; bring to a boil and cook, stirring constantly, for 5 minutes. Reduce heat to low and simmer gently,
        uncovered, and stirring occasionally until moisture evaporates, about 1 hour.</li>
        <li>Bring carrot mixture back to a boil; add sugar, raisins, cardamom, and saffron. Cook and stir until mixture has
        thickened, about 10 minutes.</li>
        <li>Ladle carrot halwa into 8 individual serving dishes. Top each serving with 1 tablespoon pistachios. Serve warm or chill
        before serving.</li>
    </ol>
